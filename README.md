# 🐛 Bug Invaders 🚀

Bug Invaders is a game built using Phaser's built-in physics plugin. It's a variation of the classic Space Invaders game, demonstrating expertise in game development and physics simulations.

## 📝 Description

In this project, we leverage the skills learned from the Phaser physics lesson to create our own version of Space Invaders. The game involves controlling a character called Codey to shoot down bugs descending from the top of the screen.

## 🎮 Features

- Player control: Move Codey left and right using arrow keys.
- Shooting: Press the spacebar to shoot bug repellent pellets.
- Enemy movement: Bugs move horizontally and descend towards Codey.
- Winning condition: Clear all bugs to win the game.
- Restart: Click anywhere on the screen to restart the game after it's over.
